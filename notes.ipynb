    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a follow up study\n",
    "- Preceded by papers:\n",
    "   - in 1961 (Manabe & Möller): radiative convective equilibrium?\n",
    "   - 1964 (Manabe/Strickler): thermal equilibrium of the atmosphere with convective adjustment\n",
    "   - 1965 (Manabe et al): Use computation (numerical integration) to model radiative transfer in the atmosphere including the hydrologic cycle\n",
    "      - Used a climatological distribution of absolute humidity as approximation\n",
    "- Next step (this paper): numerically solve the fully coupled radiative transfer and hydrological cycle elements.\n",
    "- But before doing so, compute a few radiative convective equilibria with fixed relative humidity to answer:\n",
    "  1) How fast does the atmosphere equilibriate when RH is realistic but time-invariant?\n",
    "  2) How do optical/radiative variables affect the atmosphere's equilibrium temperature under realistic but static RH conditions?\n",
    "  3) From the atmosphere temperature calculated in 1) and 2), what's the surface equilibrium temp?\n",
    "- Use those answers to sanity check more complex models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Möller 1963 discussed CO2 content vs. magnitude of LWIR at earth's surface relating to equilibrium temperature\n",
    "  - Relative vs. absolute humidity confusion\n",
    "  - Similar order-of-magnitude dependence of equilibrium temperature on CO2 content vs papers from the past 15 years\n",
    "  - \"We should probably re-evaluate\"\n"
