    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's a follow up study\n",
    "- Preceded by papers:\n",
    "   - [1964 Manabe/Strickler](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/sm6401.pdf): thermal equilibrium of the atmosphere with convective adjustment\n",
    "      - Humidity correction factor was a given vertical distribution of absolute humidity, not relative, not as a function of temperature\n",
    "   - [1961 Manabe & Möller](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/89/12/1520-0493_1961_089_0503_otreah_2_0_co_2.xml): radiative convective equilibrium\n",
    "      - mentions this [1956 paper by Phillips](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/classics.d/Phillips56.pdf) modeling energy flows numerically assuming a heat source near the equator and heat sink near the poles.\n",
    "   - [1965 Manabe et al](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/93/12/1520-0493_1965_093_0769_scoagc_2_3_co_2.xml): Use computation (numerical integration) to model radiative transfer in the atmosphere including the hydrologic cycle\n",
    "      - Used a climatological distribution of absolute humidity as approximation\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Why change the model from absolute to RH?\n",
    "  - Absolute humidity is highly coupled to temperature\n",
    "  - Average RH latitude-height distributions appear similar in winter and summer, whereas AH equivalents do not\n",
    "    - They don't provide a plot for the latter\n",
    "  - Maybe you can assume a given (fixed) vertical distribution of RH since it doesn't change much seasonally\n",
    "  - Removing an unknown saves effort for parameters that are dynamic & saves computation cycles\n",
    "  - If RH distribution is static, absolute humidity is a simple function of temperature (for a fixed altitude+latitude)\n",
    "  - If atmospheric temperatures are higher, then the absolute humidity at any given altitude is higher\n",
    "  - Long-wave infrared (LWIR) emissions to space mostly happen at the altitude surface where there isn't much more LWIR-absorbent substance (e.g. humidity) at a higher altitude to absorb outgoing photons and re-emit them downward\n",
    "    - Higher absolute humidity at all altitudes -> effective altitude of outbound LWIR emission gets higher\n",
    "      - Higher altitude => larger surface area of LWIR emission, A = 4 * pi * r^2\n",
    "      - _If the surface area grows but the outgoing LWIR power is fixed, power density (W/m2) decreases_\n",
    "    - What are the effects on the convective equilibrium if this occurs?\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Next step (this paper): numerically solve the fully coupled radiative transfer and hydrological cycle elements.\n",
    "- But before doing so, compute a few radiative convective equilibria with fixed relative humidity to answer:\n",
    "  1) How fast does the atmosphere equilibriate when RH is realistic but time-invariant?\n",
    "  2) How do optical/radiative variables affect the atmosphere's equilibrium temperature under realistic but static RH conditions?\n",
    "  3) From the atmosphere temperature calculated in 1) and 2), what's the surface equilibrium temp?\n",
    "- Use those answers to sanity check more complex models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Möller 1963 discussed CO2 content vs. magnitude of LWIR at earth's surface relating to equilibrium temperature\n",
    "  - Relative vs. absolute humidity confusion\n",
    "  - Similar order-of-magnitude dependence of equilibrium temperature on CO2 content vs papers from the past 15 years\n",
    "  - \"We should probably re-evaluate\"\n"
